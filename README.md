# lev_m0ds :: SAMP ultimate CLEO mods

A collection of cheats I personally find of great use. As of now all of them are developed by me.

Each cheat can be turn on/off by pressing *X* (can be changed in settings) and double-clicking an appropriate button. You will never ever turn your cheat on/off by accident again. And you don't need to memorize long cheat names to activate them. Convenient very much. Also each cheat can be set to stay auto-turned on/off when your game starts (can be changed in settings), therefore often times you will have an unfair advantage over others without realizing it.

## Cheats

- **AirBreak**. This is the most advanced version of airbreak you have ever seen and most definitely you will not see a better version of it anywhere else. Unless I release a better one no doubt. You all know what it does - makes you fly. Press *Enter* (can be changed in settings) to tweak all the parameters. This cheat is easily detectable, should be used with great caution. Unless you are an admin, in which case fly high and thus assert your dominance.

- **AutoCbug**. Cbug is a weird technique of shooting faster, using either *deagle* or *shotgun*. Also Cbug allows to move instantly after shooting is over (applies to many other guns). Back the day it required real skill to perform it, but not anymore. Shoot like a pro, reap rewards and impress everyone; while deep inside staying an absolute amateur. Any self-respecting server has anti-cbug system installed, therefore this cheat is disabled by default (configure `lev_m0ds.ini` file to change default behaviour).

-  **CamHack**. An airbreak spin-off! This time your character stays in place, you move camera instead.

- **CarControl**. Do you remember sitting in a car as a passenger and thinking to yourself *driver ain't got no clue how to move 'em wheels*? This cheat lets you do something about it. Activate it and take control over the car. Use with great caution as it is easily detectable.

- **MegaHop**. The concept and the cheat itself developed by me. You can bunny-hop very high using your bike, though it takes real skill to perform it. This cheat allows you to perform such tricks effortlessly. Basically undetectable, should be turned on at all times. I have been jumping around a dozen of admins lately; they would sit there staring at me doing nothing. Other than applauding my amazing bike manipulation skills.

- **NoReload**. This cheat makes sure your gun is reloading in a fluent and natural fasion of gun-swaping. It gently touches your weapon's clip each time you are low on ammo. By default this cheat is set to work in a natural way, which mimics human behaviour, therefore it's undetectable. However you can set it to work in a vulgar way of forceful reloading. It's a superior way if you don't care about getting caught since it let's you reload even when your are aiming.

- **NoSpread**. Basically you shoot without bullets spreading. This cheat is part of *lev_m0ds* since v*1.05*, but it has been made anew. Major update, crosshair mode can be changed now: (1) keep the original behaviour, (2) force it to appear instantly when aiming, (3) force it to stay on screen permanently. Crosshair retains original behaviour by default.

- **RadioHack**. A hack, not a cheat really. It turns off annoying radio when you get into a car.

-  **Teleport**. Make yourself a little tour around the map.

## Installation

- Extract files directly to your game folder. Done.

## Not working?

- single player not supported, SAMP v0.3.7-R5 only!
- make sure you have CLEO v4.4.1 (or higher) in place. Compatibility with other CLEO versions not guaranteed. 
- read `lev_m0ds.log` file, sometimes it's written in there what's the problem.

##

That's that, time to go wreck havoc on those SAMP servers!
